When the adventurers first arrive, the slaad gives them a wave, and returns to his hut (see above) to drink a potion. The comprehend languages spell only allows a creature to understand the literal meanings of words it hears. If the party uses any slang or parlance, the Alchemist expresses confusion.</em></p>\n<p><em>If the party ever returns unannounced, the slaad will not have drank a potion, trapping it in a precarious situation.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<section class=\"secret\">In this cavern, a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"YWUxZmU4MmZlYTQx\"><strong>green slaad</strong></a> posing as a human alchemist makes its home. Its lair has the following features:\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gourds.</strong> The walls are set with shelves at various heights. They hold numerous gourds, most of which contain failed alchemical elixirs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stone Block.</strong> A rough-hewn block of stone in the middle of the cave serves as a table. It is covered with a set of alchemist&rsquo;s supplies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Almost a year ago, the green slaad was drawn to Undermountain, deprived of its control gem, and set loose by Halaster. It has explored several levels of the dungeon in its quest to find the gem. For now, it has adopted the guise of a scatterbrained, shabbily dressed young man who has, for reasons he would rather not divulge, set up an alchemist&rsquo;s lab in this cave. The slaad refers to itself only as &ldquo;the Alchemist&rdquo; and claims to have been kidnapped by Halaster from someplace it can&rsquo;t remember.</p>\n<p>The Alchemist bargains with creatures for materials it needs, trading potions for fungi and equipment. What it&rsquo;s really looking for is its control gem, which it senses is close by (see area 21a). It doesn&rsquo;t want help finding the gem, though, for fear that the treasure might fall into the hands of those who try to control the slaad. If the characters obtain the gem and return it to the Alchemist, it cheers, turns invisible, and flees with the gem.</p>\n<p>If the characters seem interested in knowing more about the Twisted Caverns, the slaad warns them about the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MDgwODQ4OGQ5ZTkw\"><strong>ropers</strong></a>&nbsp;in area 6. Also, it has struck up a friendship with the &ldquo;two-headed giant&rdquo; in area 2 and urges the characters to speak with it, since it has lived on this level for a long time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Potions for Sale</h4>\nThe Alchemist is happy to trade potions for supplies. For one potion, it demands 20 pounds of edible fungi and five tongues of madness (which characters can harvest from the surrounding caves), plus 50 gp worth of adventuring gear. The Alchemist has no use for coins, gemstones, art objects, or magic items. Each time the characters pay the Alchemist a visit, it has one of each of the potions described below available to trade. Each potion is a common magic item. It keeps these potions on its person, and a sneaky character can try to pilfer one with a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the slaad&rsquo;s Wisdom (Perception) check.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Potion of Comprehension.</strong> When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of a comprehend languages spell for 1 hour. This liquid is a clear concoction with bits of salt and soot swirling in it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Potion of Watchful Rest.</strong> When you drink this potion, you gain the following benefits for the next 8 hours: magic can&rsquo;t put you to sleep, and you can remain awake during a long rest and still gain its benefits.

A Little Privacy</h4><div><div><section class=\"secret\">\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Drow.</strong> Melith, a <a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"Zjc3ZWMwMzI5Nzg3\"><strong>drow priestess of Lolth</strong></a> and the leader of this outpost, meditates and prays before a shrine of Lolth while her consort, the&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NWExODY0MzBhOTJi\"><strong>drow mage</strong></a>&nbsp;Thirza, sits at a zurkhwood desk reading her spellbook.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Furnishings.</strong> The cave contains two sleeping pallets and a zurkhwood chest. A skewered darkmantle cooks over a spider-shaped bronze brazier filled with flaming coals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If she had her way, Melith would launch a full-scale assault on the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NDgxOTM3ZTY0NDBj\"><strong>kuo-toa</strong></a>, wipe them out, and then deal with the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OWE2NzU3ZGI0YmRl\"><strong>aboleth</strong></a>. As things are, she relies on her sister, T’rissa Auvryndar (see level 3), for soldiers, and T’rissa does not support such a strategy. So, armed with only a small force, Melith has been forced to watch and wait as the aboleth and the kuo-toa plot to annihilate one another.</p>\n<p>Melith is happy to let adventurers meddle in the war between the aboleth and the kuo-toa. If the characters approach her peacefully, she suggests a temporary—but mutually beneficial—alliance. Melith knows that the only route between this level of Undermountain and the next one down is the underground river. If the characters slay the aboleth or the <a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OGI3YzA2ZDhmNmI2\">kuo-toa archpriest</a> and return to her with proof of its demise, Melith promises to furnish them with a raft that they can use to navigate the underground river and continue their descent through Undermountain. Such a raft is stored in area 14, and Melith makes good on her promise.</p>\n<p>Though she has great affection for Melith, Thirza sees any alliance with the characters as an opportunity to elevate herself in the eyes of Melith’s mother, Vlonwelv. After Melith concludes her business with the characters, Thirza prepares and casts a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"Y2E4ZTJkMzZjMjIz\">sending</a></em> spell to contact Vlonwelv. She warns Vlonwelv that Melith has released a group of adventurers from her custody instead of killing them. After thanking Thirza for the information, Vlonwelv curses her daughter’s foolishness and awaits the adventurers’ arrival.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The drow priestess wears two silver bracelets set with onyx (25 gp each). She carries a flask of wine and the key to the room’s zurkhwood chest, which contains 500 gp. The lock on the chest can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, or opened with a knock spell or similar magic. Melith’s shrine contains a 1-pound obsidian figurine of the demon goddess Lolth in spider form (25 gp) and eight sticks of incense (5 gp each). Each stick burns for up to 8 hours and emits a sickly odor.</p>\n<p>Thirza carries a spell scroll of <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"YzUwMTMwYWNmYmY0\">gaseous form</a></em> in a waterproof zurkhwood tube, 25 pp in a spider silk pouch, and her spellbook, which has black leather covers traced with webs of gold.

Grotto of Madness</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Silence is your only welcome in this lightless grotto, softened only by the gentle lapping of water against the shores of some far-off little island at the heart of this darkness. All is quiet. All but the water is still. Dread chokes your heart and your mind&hellip; your mind shudders beneath some looming shadow&mdash;a psychic presence you can't shake, a gaze you can't escape.</em></p>\n<p><em>Out from the darkness slithers that velvet voice again, slipping up your spine and into your very mind:</em></p>\n<p><em>\"We will be one.\"</em></p>\n</section>\n<p><em>The adventurers have come to Illuun's waiting arms at long last, and together, with the aboleth's three chuuls, Illuun shall usher in a new age, a golden age.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><em>Halaster's Game.</em></h3>\n<p><em>The island's otyugh statue instead depicts the Mad Mage, with a few strange additions from the kuo-toa.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><em>TACTICS</em></h3>\n<p><em>You owe it to yourself and your players to make this fight as vicious as possible. Hold nothing back. Illuun's Tactics. With an 18 Intelligence, the aboleth has devised an excellent strategy, which plays out in the following tactics. \"LA\" refers to its Legendary Actions.</em></p>\n<p><em>&bull; Despite coveting the adventurers as its newest disciples, Illuun is ready to kill those necessary and enslave any survivors once they're weakened.</em></p>\n<p><em>&bull; Illuun, as well as its minions, prefer to fight in the water. It will attack long before the party reaches the island, knowing it is disadvantaged there. Should any of them land, it can use a Lair Action to pull them back into the lake.</em></p>\n<p><em>&bull; Illuun's attacks have a reach of 10 ft., forcing it to come close to the water's surface and to beach itself if the party is on the heart of the island. Thus, it's imperative that Illuun uses his Enslave ability early to split the adventurers.</em></p>\n<p><em>&bull; With a reach of 10 ft., +5 to Strength (Athletics) checks and three Tentacle attacks, Illuun should always be grappling weak creatures, pulling them underwater.</em></p>\n<p><em>&bull; If an enslaved creature is about to be freed or killed, Illuun targets it with a Psychic Drain LA to regain hit points.</em></p>\n<p><em>&bull; Illuun wants a character to touch or attack it while in melee range underwater, so they're exposed to its Mucous Cloud trait. If infected, that character can only breathe underwater&mdash; thus limiting them to Illuun's home turf.</em></p>\n<p><em>&bull; Using a Lair Action, Illuun casts phantasmal force, creating illusory boats or islands that the adventurers might make for. A creature under that spell always rationalizes why things don't pan out and will still consider the illusion real. Chuuls' Tactics. The chuuls are in sync with their master's stratagem and follow these tactics:</em></p>\n<p><em>&bull; The chuuls attack the weakest targets (already determined by Illuun), hauling grappled characters into the water and paralyzing them with a Tentacles attack.</em></p>\n<p><em>&bull; Invisible characters, as well as those holding magic items, can't hide from a chuul, per its Sense Magic feature.</em></p>\n<p><em>&bull; The two chuuls from Area 17, if alive, reach the Grotto of Madness on the fourth round of combat.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Additional Forces.</strong> </em><em>If you find that the adventurers are wiping the floor with Illuun and its chuuls, add 1d4 creatures randomly composed of drow, kuo-toa, or troglodytes (all enslaved with a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw on taking damage to break free).</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><em>HALASTER'S GAME</em></h3>\n<p><em>If you use the variant described in this supplement, Noogaloop, the kuo-toa archpriest, a kuo-toa whip, and three kuo-toa tag along with the party. They're effectively noncombatants, for their entire turns are consumed by performing a ritual to regain their god's favor. Noogaloop leads the three kuo-toa in the ritual while the whip stands guard. Noogaloop must perform the ritual for three consecutive rounds; if he becomes incapacitated, the ritual is interrupted and must be started anew. To participate in the ritual requires an action; if the participant isn't a kuo-toa, it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma (Performance) check to follow the ritual dance.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Ritual. </em></strong><em>The ritual is completely mundane and requires no magic at all, but Noogaloop adds his own flair anyway. A character that observes the kuo-toa realize that this dance is just an abasement: the fishfolk debase themselves before their god with gestures that would otherwise be mistaken as jests.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Salvation.</strong> </em><em>If Noogaloop successfully performs his ritual, the Mad Mage's theme song plays: the kuo-toa has \"won\" Halaster's Game. Read the following:</em></p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Music thunders throughout the cavern; Illuun's conscious, a constant presence you can sense like a looming shadow, shudders and dwindles as the Mad Mage's voice booms:</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Well done! Well done, Noogaloop! My man, my star! You've gone and won my game! Never shall your great people forget your name, for paradise is theirs at last! Your faith has been rewarded, your devotion rewarded, your foolishness&mdash;rewarded!\"</em></p>\n<p><em>A wind ripples throughout the cavern, a violet tempest that encircles the kuo-toa, spiriting them into the air. With the crash of thunder, a rift materializes above: you catch sight of some angelic grotto lit by a swollen moon. That violet tempest hurls the kuo-toa through the rift and into that watery paradise yonder&mdash;and just as quickly as it came, the portal snaps shut and winks out of existence. The music comes to a shuddering halt and the Mad Mage's presence disappears.</em></p>\n</section>\n<p><em>Halaster teleports Noogaloop and any other kuo-toa out of the Grotto of Madness to a pocket dimension. If the adventurers return to Area 20, they find all the kuo-toa gone, also spirited away to that watery promised land.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>\n<section class=\"secret\">Illuun the aboleth has turned this flooded cavern into a den. The cavern is also defended by three chuuls that are under the aboleth&rsquo;s sway.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The water varies in depth from 20 to 50 feet, and the cavern&rsquo;s domed ceiling is 30 feet higher than the water&rsquo;s surface. The walls are coated with slime but have abundant handholds. A successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check is required to climb them.</p>\n<h4>16a. Lost Island of Bulba-Slopp</h4>\n<p>Rising out of the water is a rocky island upon which the kuo-toa raised a shrine to their old god:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chuul.</strong> Circling the island&rsquo;s perimeter is a <a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MmI4NWYwZDk3NjNk\"><strong>chuul</strong></a> that attacks anyone who sets foot on the island.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Petrified Otyugh.</strong> In the middle of the island, wearing a crude net as a cloak, is a petrified <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NzRhZjJjYmNlYjA3\"><strong>otyugh</strong></a> that the kuo-toa adopted as a god and named Bulba-Slopp. Treasure has been piled around the statue&rsquo;s three stumpy legs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Before the kuo-toa arrived, this island was inhabited by an otyugh. Halaster turned it to stone and lured kuo-toa to the grotto, knowing that the insane fish folk would come to worship the petrified otyugh as a god. The kuo-toa named it Bulba-Slopp, and it served as their god until the aboleth came on the scene. After Bulba-Slopp failed to protect the kuo-toa, the archpriest Noolgaloop set out to craft a new god, and Bulba-Slopp was worshiped no more.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Piled around the petrified otyugh&rsquo;s feet are 3,300 cp, 670 sp, and 350 gp.</p>\n<p>The net draped over the otyugh is woven with worthless shells and bones. Tied to the net are two trinkets (roll twice on the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZjAzMWFmNDA5ZTZk\">Trinkets table</a> in chapter 5 of the Player&rsquo;s Handbook), a rusty gauntlet, a leather boot, and an amulet made of composite wood and iron. The boot and the amulet are both magical:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The boot is one of two boots of elvenkind. A single boot is useless without its companion. The matching boot was swept downriver and eventually found by a goblin werebat named Vool (see level 5, area 17).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The amulet controls the wandering <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZmVmYTcyMjY0NmYy\"><strong>shield guardian</strong></a> on level 1. A rune on the back of the amulet matches a similar rune on the construct.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>16b. Lake of the Aboleth</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Monsters.</strong> Illuun the aboleth and two chuuls lurk in the water, which is dark, slimy, and fouled by the aboleth&rsquo;s presence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Underwater Tunnel.</strong> A 10-foot-high, 20-foot-wide underwater passage connects this cavern to area 16c.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The aboleth and the chuuls prefer to fight underwater.

These kuo-toa have been magically enslaved by the aboleth. While enslaved, the kuo-toa remain in constant telepathic contact with the aboleth, but they can&rsquo;t take reactions. Whenever an enslaved kuo-toa takes damage, it can make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw to break free of the aboleth&rsquo;s control.

If the battle is not going their way, a second whistle brings the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NzczM2ZhMTk0YzM1\"><strong>quaggoths</strong></a>&nbsp;from area 12b.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Balryn wears an obsidian scarab bearing the insignia of House Auvryndar (25 gp).</p>\n<p>The supplies stored in this cave include a set of carpenter’s tools, a set of leatherworker’s tools, five sets of manacles, and enough rations to feed one humanoid for 90 days or the entire drow contingent (including the drow in area 12a) for 9 days.</p>\n<h4>11b.

As things are, she relies on her sister, T’rissa Auvryndar (see level 3), for soldiers, and T’rissa does not support such a strategy. So, armed with only a small force, Melith has been forced to watch and wait as the aboleth and the kuo-toa plot to annihilate one another.</p>\n<p>Melith is happy to let adventurers meddle in the war between the aboleth and the kuo-toa. If the characters approach her peacefully, she suggests a temporary—but mutually beneficial—alliance. Melith knows that the only route between this level of Undermountain and the next one down is the underground river. If the characters slay the aboleth or the <a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OGI3YzA2ZDhmNmI2\">kuo-toa archpriest</a> and return to her with proof of its demise, Melith promises to furnish them with a raft that they can use to navigate the underground river and continue their descent through Undermountain. Such a raft is stored in area 14, and Melith makes good on her promise.</p>\n<p>Though she has great affection for Melith, Thirza sees any alliance with the characters as an opportunity to elevate herself in the eyes of Melith’s mother, Vlonwelv. After Melith concludes her business with the characters, Thirza prepares and casts a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"Y2E4ZTJkMzZjMjIz\">sending</a></em> spell to contact Vlonwelv. She warns Vlonwelv that Melith has released a group of adventurers from her custody instead of killing them. After thanking Thirza for the information, Vlonwelv curses her daughter’s foolishness and awaits the adventurers’ arrival.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The drow priestess wears two silver bracelets set with onyx (25 gp each). She carries a flask of wine and the key to the room’s zurkhwood chest, which contains 500 gp. The lock on the chest can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, or opened with a knock spell or similar magic. Melith’s shrine contains a 1-pound obsidian figurine of the demon goddess Lolth in spider form (25 gp) and eight sticks of incense (5 gp each). Each stick burns for up to 8 hours and emits a sickly odor.</p>\n<p>Thirza carries a spell scroll of <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"YzUwMTMwYWNmYmY0\">gaseous form</a></em> in a waterproof zurkhwood tube, 25 pp in a spider silk pouch, and her spellbook, which has black leather covers traced with webs of gold.

Many of these fungi are edible or have useful properties. Species of fungus found on this level and elsewhere in Undermountain include the following.</p><p></p><p></p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">Barrelstalk</h4><p>A barrelstalk is a cask-shaped fungus that can be tapped and drained of the water inside it. A single barrelstalk contains 1d4 + 4 gallons of fresh water. Its husk provides 1d6 + 4 pounds of food.</p><p></p><p></p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">Bluecap</h4><p>Dubbed “the grain of the Underdark,” a bluecap is a tall, slender mushroom with a bright blue, bell-shaped cap. Although bluecaps are inedible, their spores can be ground to make a nutritious, bland flour. Bread made from bluecap flour is known as sporebread or bluebread. One loaf is equivalent to 1 pound of food.</p><p></p><p></p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">Ripplebark</h4><p>This shelf-like fungus resembles a mass of rotting flesh, but it’s surprisingly edible. Though it can be eaten raw, it tastes better roasted. A single sheet of ripplebark yields 1d4 + 6 pounds of food.</p><p></p><p></p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">Timmask</h4><p>Known as “devil’s mushroom,” a timmask is a 2-foot-tall toadstool with orange and red stripes across its beige cap. Uprooting or destroying a timmask causes it to expel a 15-foot-radius cloud of poisonous spores. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a creature is under the effect of a confusion spell with a duration of 1 minute. When the spell effect ends, the poisoned condition also ends.</p><p></p><p></p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">Trillimac</h4><p>A trillimac is a mushroom that grows to a height of 4 to 5 feet and has a broad, gray-green cap with a light gray stalk. The cap’s leathery surface can be cut and cleaned for use in making maps, hats, and scrolls; its surface takes on dyes and inks especially well. The stalk can be cleaned, soaked in water for an hour, then dried to make a palatable food akin to bread. Each trillimac stalk provides 1d6 + 4 pounds of food.</p><p></p><p></p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">Tongue of Madness</h4><p>A tongue of madness looks like a large human tongue. Although it is edible, it holds no nutritional value. A creature that eats this fungus must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or compulsively speak aloud its every thought for the next hour. The effect can be ended with a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Item data-id=ODEzYjBmMmE4NDE5 ><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i><i>lesser restoration</i></a> spell or similar magic.</p><p></p><p></p><h4 style=\"font-family: &#34;helvetica neue&#34; , &#34;helvetica&#34; , &#34;arial&#34; , sans-serif\">Zurkhwood</h4><p>A zurkhwood is a mushroom that can grow up to 40 feet high. Its large, grain-like spores are edible (one specimen provides 1d4 + 4 pounds of food), but the fungus is more important for its hard and woody stalk. Zurkhwood is one of the few sources of timber in the Underdark; it is used to make furniture, containers, bridges, and rafts, among other things. Skilled crafters can use stains, sanding, and polishing to bring out different patterns in a zurkhwood stalk.<br></p></section>","img":"","_id":"Ws8k5o1DNYqGv2nJ"}

It is covered with a set of alchemist&rsquo;s supplies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Almost a year ago, the green slaad was drawn to Undermountain, deprived of its control gem, and set loose by Halaster. It has explored several levels of the dungeon in its quest to find the gem. For now, it has adopted the guise of a scatterbrained, shabbily dressed young man who has, for reasons he would rather not divulge, set up an alchemist&rsquo;s lab in this cave. The slaad refers to itself only as &ldquo;the Alchemist&rdquo; and claims to have been kidnapped by Halaster from someplace it can&rsquo;t remember.</p>\n<p>The Alchemist bargains with creatures for materials it needs, trading potions for fungi and equipment. What it&rsquo;s really looking for is its control gem, which it senses is close by (see area 21a). It doesn&rsquo;t want help finding the gem, though, for fear that the treasure might fall into the hands of those who try to control the slaad. If the characters obtain the gem and return it to the Alchemist, it cheers, turns invisible, and flees with the gem.</p>\n<p>If the characters seem interested in knowing more about the Twisted Caverns, the slaad warns them about the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MDgwODQ4OGQ5ZTkw\"><strong>ropers</strong></a>&nbsp;in area 6. Also, it has struck up a friendship with the &ldquo;two-headed giant&rdquo; in area 2 and urges the characters to speak with it, since it has lived on this level for a long time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Potions for Sale</h4>\nThe Alchemist is happy to trade potions for supplies. For one potion, it demands 20 pounds of edible fungi and five tongues of madness (which characters can harvest from the surrounding caves), plus 50 gp worth of adventuring gear. The Alchemist has no use for coins, gemstones, art objects, or magic items. Each time the characters pay the Alchemist a visit, it has one of each of the potions described below available to trade. Each potion is a common magic item. It keeps these potions on its person, and a sneaky character can try to pilfer one with a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the slaad&rsquo;s Wisdom (Perception) check.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Potion of Comprehension.</strong> When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of a comprehend languages spell for 1 hour. This liquid is a clear concoction with bits of salt and soot swirling in it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Potion of Watchful Rest.</strong> When you drink this potion, you gain the following benefits for the next 8 hours: magic can&rsquo;t put you to sleep, and you can remain awake during a long rest and still gain its benefits. This sweet, amber-colored brew has no effect on creatures that don&rsquo;t require sleep, such as elves.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>5. Cave of Crystals</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Xorn.</strong> Three <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZDcwMWVmMDIyN2Ew\"><strong>xorn</strong></a> feast on crystals near the western edge of the cavern, while harmless bats flutter below the 30-foot-high ceiling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Difficult Terrain.</strong> A thick mix of mud and bat guano covers the ground. Treat this area as difficult terrain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The xorn protect their crystalline food source. If a xorn loses more than half its hit points, it disengages from combat on its next turn and sinks into the floor, never to return.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Treasure</h4>\nOnce the xorn are defeated, the characters can retrieve forty fist-sized crystals worth 10 gp each.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>6. Tangled Ropes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ropers.</strong> This 30-foot-high cave holds a forest of stalagmites, some of which are broken. Two <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MDgwODQ4OGQ5ZTkw\"><strong>ropers</strong></a>&nbsp;lurk among them and ambush anyone who happens by.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Uneven Floor.</strong> The uneven floor is strewn with bits of chewed-up armor and bone, as well as the occasional copper piece or silver piece.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Treasure</h4>\nEach roper has 1d4 gemstones (100 gp each) lodged in its gizzard, which characters can cut open once the roper is dead. They can also gather up a total of 32 cp and 11 sp scattered across the floor.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>7. Mad Wizard&rsquo;s Retreat</h3>\nA human wizard, the lone survivor of an expedition to the Underdark, has taken refuge in this 30-foot-high cave. The cave contains the following:\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Light.</strong> Phosphorescent moss growing in patches on the walls dimly lights the entire cave.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fungi.</strong> Gardens of barrelstalk, ripplebark, timmask, and tongue of madness grow throughout.&nbsp;(see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YTI4YWZjZjRhYjUz\">Fungi</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mage.</strong> Near the north wall, a slight woman wearing tattered gray robes over black pants sits on a 2-foot-tall toadstool. Her long black hair is tied back with a swatch of gray cloth that matches her robe. A <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OTU0MzVlMWJiZjJl\"><strong>quasit</strong></a> in toad form sits on her knee.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Darribeth Meltimer</h4>\n<p>The woman is Darribeth Meltimer (CG female Chondathan human <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NDYwOWI2MWQzOWZk\"><strong>mage</strong></a>, with the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"NmZkNDZhODFiNjEz\"><em>darkvision</em></a> spell cast on herself and prepared instead of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"YWU2Mzc2NDJlMjU1\"><em>suggestion</em></a>). A former adventurer, she was driven insane by contact with demons in the Underdark. A <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"MDI0Mjk4MjI2ZjZh\"><em>greater restoration</em></a> spell or similar magic is needed to restore her sanity, without which Darribeth suffers from hallucinations and paranoia. If the characters approach her in a calm manner, Darribeth smiles and says to the toad on her knee, <em>&ldquo;Look, Teeha! I told you they&rsquo;re not demons. I wonder if Urgala sent them.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>Darribeth desperately wants to get back to her wife Urgala, whom she hasn&rsquo;t seen in a decade. When last they were together, Urgala and Darribeth were living in Amphail, a town north of Waterdeep. In the intervening years, Urgala moved farther north to the frontier town of Triboar, where she took over a modest inn called Northshield House. (See the adventure <a href=\"https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/module/25/storm-kings-thunder\">Storm King&rsquo;s Thunder</a> for more information on Urgala Meltimer and her inn.)</p>\nIf her sanity is restored, Darribeth becomes her normal self&mdash;a curious and kind woman with a flair for magic who doesn&rsquo;t mind bending rules for the greater good. She speaks Common, Dwarvish, Halfling, and Undercommon.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Darribeth has a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NDAzN2YzYjg0ZTgx\"><em>rope of climbing</em></a> that belonged to a colleague who perished in the Underdark. She offers it as payment for getting her back to the surface. In addition, if any wizards are among her rescuers, she lets them copy spells from her spellbook (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</p>\n<p>Once restored to her right mind and borne safely to Waterdeep, Darribeth makes plans to return to Amphail. There, she learns what became of her wife and reunites with Urgala in Triboar. If the characters make the journey with Darribeth and all is well at Northshield House, Urgala is so delighted by their act of kindness that she offers them free room and board for as long as the inn remains standing. Urgala and Darribeth remain lifelong friends of the characters henceforth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Quasit</h4>\nDarribeth&rsquo;s memory is fuzzy on where and when she met her talking toad during her Underdark exploits. The <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OTU0MzVlMWJiZjJl\"><strong>quasit</strong></a>, which Darribeth calls Teeha, has not revealed its true form to her. In the form of a toad, it torments her with false hopes of escape before dashing them. It has told Darribeth, for instance, that <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZGY3MTk5ZjMyNTI5\"><strong>hezrou</strong></a> demons are nearby to keep her from leaving this cavern. If attacked or exposed, the quasit turns invisible and flees.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Treasure</h4>\nDarribeth&rsquo;s spellbook contains the following spells: <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"YTJhNTEzNmMyMDdj\">cone of cold</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"OTgwYzdmYjRmM2I5\">counterspell</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"NmZkNDZhODFiNjEz\">darkvision</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZWRlY2M2ZWIzMTdl\">detect magic</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"MjMyMDgyM2RmMTcx\">fireball</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ODQ4NzQ0OGQ4ODQw\">fly</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZjEyYTE5YTJhODBh\">greater invisibility</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZjA4MGM4ZTlmMzg0\">ice storm</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"MGJhNWNlNzk4ZDAw\">jump</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"MmE3MzYzMWNiMjUw\">mage armor</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"YmNkNWZhYjg1MDg0\">magic missile</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"OTEyODg5ODMxMGQ4\">misty step</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"NDlkZGI4YTU4YjRk\">shield</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"YWU2Mzc2NDJlMjU1\">suggestion</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZDI2YzcxZjExMjhi\">tongues</a></em>, and <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"OTJkOGI4MmE2MmI1\">water breathing</a></em>.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to her spellbook, Darribeth carries a backpack missing a strap, within which she keeps material components for her spells, a pouch containing 11 gp, a dagger, a canteen, and a worn blanket. Fastened to the backpack is a coiled <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NDAzN2YzYjg0ZTgx\">rope of climbing</a></em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>8. Crossroads</h3>\n<p>The ceiling of this 30-foot-high cavern is studded with stalactites, and the floor is so uneven that it counts as difficult terrain. A search of the cavern reveals nothing dangerous or valuable.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>9. Alarm System</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sloped Roof.</strong> The ceiling is 30 feet high at the northwest end of the cave and gradually slopes down to 20 feet high as the cavern narrows into a passage that leads to area 10.</li>\n<li><strong>Tripwires.</strong> The uneven rock floor is dotted with small stalagmites, between which run nearly invisible trip wires made of webbing. These web strands set off hidden rockfall traps.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The driders in area 10 have strung thin web strands between some of the stalagmites, creating trip wires. Any creature that enters a square marked T on the map has a 50 percent chance of breaking a strand and triggering a trap that releases rocks from a hidden crevice in the ceiling. If a trap triggers, all creatures occupying the trapped square must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a falling rock for 5 (1d10) bludgeoning damage. In addition, the sound of the falling rocks alerts the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MTQzYzc1NmIyYzVi\"><strong>driders</strong></a>&nbsp;in area 10.</p>\nA character adjacent to a trapped square or in a trapped square can spot the trip wires with a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check, then track the thin webs to the point in the ceiling where the rocks are hidden. Once it is spotted, a rockfall trap can be disabled with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check by a creature in the trapped square; failing this check triggers the trap.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Tunnel to Expanded Dungeon</h4>\nIf you want to expand the dungeon north or east of here, assume that the tunnel in the north wall is hidden behind a 1-foot-thick wall of rocks held in place by web netting and clay mortar; characters can detect the false wall with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check and break through it with ease.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>10. Drider Lair</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Driders and Spiders.</strong> The northern half of the cave is home to two&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MTQzYzc1NmIyYzVi\"><strong>driders</strong></a>&nbsp;and five <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZjlhYzMzY2FlOTY0\"><strong>giant spiders</strong></a>. The driders hide in the natural alcove north of the entrance, while the spiders crawl amid thick webs that fill the top 10 feet beneath the 30-foot-high ceiling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hidden Arch.</strong> The southern half of the cave is filled with thick, sticky webs. (These webs conceal an arch embedded in a wall at the south end of the cave. The arch is not visible from the cave entrance because of the webs concealing it.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The driders while away the days carving zurkhwood figurines and writing poems on the caps of trillimacs in Undercommon. A sample haiku is presented below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>My Queen of Spiders,<br />Dark diamond of the Abyss,<br />Snare me in your web.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Arch Gate to Level 6</h4>\nA character entering the cave through the arch gate automatically becomes stuck in the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"OWI1MmZjZWY1ZWQx\">webs</a> (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"Yzk2Y2U3MDk3Yjk5\">Dungeon Hazards</a>).\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Carved into the arch are six stone niches, each one containing a small stone figurine that weighs 1 pound. The figurines represent a black dragon, a unicorn, an umber hulk, an owlbear, a minotaur, and a manticore. Carved into the wall inside the arch is a stylized image of a mountain with a full moon symbol above it. Close inspection of the moon reveals a half-inch-diameter hole in the middle of it.</p>\n<p>The arch is one of Halaster&rsquo;s magic gates (see \"Gates\" in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"N2ZiM2VkY2JiZWJk\">Dungeon Features</a>). Its rules are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the horn of the unicorn figurine is inserted into the hole in the moon symbol, the gate opens for 1 minute. None of the other figurines have protrusions that fit in the hole.</li>\n<li>Characters must be 9th level or higher to pass through this gate (see &ldquo;Jhesiyra Kestellharp\" in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NzQwYzk3NjBmMGQ2\">Undermountain Secrets</a>). The first creature to pass through the gate triggers an elder rune (see \"Elder Runes\" in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"N2ZiM2VkY2JiZWJk\">Dungeon Features</a>).</li>\n<li>A creature that passes through the gate appears in area 27 on level 6, in the closest unoccupied space next to the similar gate located there.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Treasure</h4>\nOne drider has a set of calligrapher&rsquo;s tools. The other drider carries a set of woodcarver&rsquo;s tools and three carved zurkhwood statues of Lolth (1 gp each).\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>11. Drow Outpost</h3>\nThe drow of House Auvryndar established this outpost after discovering the arch gate in area 11c. All told, this area contains a drow priestess of Lolth named Melith Auvryndar, a female drow mage named Thirza Helviiryn (Melith&rsquo;s consort), two female drow elite warriors&nbsp;named Balryn and Talafaere, and four male drow named Altonrel, Kalanszar, Rezz, and Tsabalin.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>11a. Main Cavern</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Drow.</strong> Two male&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OTVhYmI5NmM0MGUz\"><strong>drow</strong></a>&nbsp;(Altonrel and Rezz) and a female&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"color: #23527c; outline: 0px;\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MTk1NDJiNTdhMzcy\"><strong>drow elite warrior</strong></a>&nbsp;(Balryn) stand watch atop a ridge of natural rock in the middle of this 30-foot-high cave.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fungi.</strong> Barrelstalk and ripplebark grow in small gardens around the ridge. (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YTI4YWZjZjRhYjUz\">Fungi</a>.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Provisions.</strong> Stacks of supplies and gear neatly line the walls, while a small iron pot sits on stones in one alcove.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the characters enter in a nonthreatening manner, the guards are cautious but willing to summon their leaders to speak on their behalf. If greeted with hostility, the drow elite warrior sounds the alarm with a single whistle, bringing reinforcements from areas 11b and 11c. If the battle is not going their way, a second whistle brings the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NzczM2ZhMTk0YzM1\"><strong>quaggoths</strong></a>&nbsp;from area 12b.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Balryn wears an obsidian scarab bearing the insignia of House Auvryndar (25 gp).</p>\n<p>The supplies stored in this cave include a set of carpenter&rsquo;s tools, a set of leatherworker&rsquo;s tools, five sets of manacles, and enough rations to feed one humanoid for 90 days or the entire drow contingent (including the drow in area 12a) for 9 days.</p>\n<h4>11b. A Little Privacy</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Drow.</strong> Melith, a <a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"Zjc3ZWMwMzI5Nzg3\"><strong>drow priestess of Lolth</strong></a> and the leader of this outpost, meditates and prays before a shrine of Lolth while her consort, the&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NWExODY0MzBhOTJi\"><strong>drow mage</strong></a>&nbsp;Thirza, sits at a zurkhwood desk reading her spellbook.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Furnishings.</strong> The cave contains two sleeping pallets and a zurkhwood chest. A skewered darkmantle cooks over a spider-shaped bronze brazier filled with flaming coals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If she had her way, Melith would launch a full-scale assault on the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NDgxOTM3ZTY0NDBj\"><strong>kuo-toa</strong></a>, wipe them out, and then deal with the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OWE2NzU3ZGI0YmRl\"><strong>aboleth</strong></a>. As things are, she relies on her sister, T&rsquo;rissa Auvryndar (see level 3), for soldiers, and T&rsquo;rissa does not support such a strategy. So, armed with only a small force, Melith has been forced to watch and wait as the aboleth and the kuo-toa plot to annihilate one another.</p>\n<p>Melith is happy to let adventurers meddle in the war between the aboleth and the kuo-toa. If the characters approach her peacefully, she suggests a temporary&mdash;but mutually beneficial&mdash;alliance. Melith knows that the only route between this level of Undermountain and the next one down is the underground river. If the characters slay the aboleth or the <a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OGI3YzA2ZDhmNmI2\">kuo-toa archpriest</a> and return to her with proof of its demise, Melith promises to furnish them with a raft that they can use to navigate the underground river and continue their descent through Undermountain. Such a raft is stored in area 14, and Melith makes good on her promise.</p>\n<p>Though she has great affection for Melith, Thirza sees any alliance with the characters as an opportunity to elevate herself in the eyes of Melith&rsquo;s mother, Vlonwelv. After Melith concludes her business with the characters, Thirza prepares and casts a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"Y2E4ZTJkMzZjMjIz\">sending</a></em> spell to contact Vlonwelv. She warns Vlonwelv that Melith has released a group of adventurers from her custody instead of killing them. After thanking Thirza for the information, Vlonwelv curses her daughter&rsquo;s foolishness and awaits the adventurers&rsquo; arrival.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> The drow priestess wears two silver bracelets set with onyx (25 gp each). She carries a flask of wine and the key to the room&rsquo;s zurkhwood chest, which contains 500 gp. The lock on the chest can be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves&rsquo; tools, or opened with a knock spell or similar magic. Melith&rsquo;s shrine contains a 1-pound obsidian figurine of the demon goddess Lolth in spider form (25 gp) and eight sticks of incense (5 gp each). Each stick burns for up to 8 hours and emits a sickly odor.</p>\n<p>Thirza carries a spell scroll of <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"YzUwMTMwYWNmYmY0\">gaseous form</a></em> in a waterproof zurkhwood tube, 25 pp in a spider silk pouch, and her spellbook, which has black leather covers traced with webs of gold. The book contains the following spells: <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"NDkxNWVmYTRiYjE2\">alter self</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"M2NkNzBkYjk4NTY4\">cloudkill</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells%3AEvard's%20Black%20Tentacles\">Evard&rsquo;s black tentacles</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ODQ4NzQ0OGQ4ODQw\">fly</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZjEyYTE5YTJhODBh\">greater invisibility</a></em>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"MGNiNDQyYzUzNmVi\">lightning bolt</a>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"MmE3MzYzMWNiMjUw\">mage armor</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"YmNkNWZhYjg1MDg0\">magic missile</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"OTEyODg5ODMxMGQ4\">misty step</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"Y2E4ZTJkMzZjMjIz\">sending</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"NDlkZGI4YTU4YjRk\">shield</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZDI0ZDA2YzMxYmVl\">sleep</a></em>, <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"MDkxYWE0YzNkNjQ2\">spider climb</a></em>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"NDMxYWI4MzFiYjdl\"><em>web</em></a>, and <em><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells%3AWitch%20Bolt\">witch bolt</a></em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>11c.

Its rules are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feeding a gold coin into the keystone&rsquo;s slot causes the coin to disappear and the gate to open for 1 minute. Other coins placed in the slot disappear but don&rsquo;t open the gate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Characters must be 6th level or higher to pass through this gate (see &ldquo;Jhesiyra Kestellharp\" in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NzQwYzk3NjBmMGQ2\">Undermountain Secrets</a>).

Bat Cave</h3>\nThe drow and their quaggoths recently expanded into this cavern, which is home to hundreds of bats.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>12a. Drow Sentinels</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sloped Roof.</strong> The ceiling here is 50 feet high but slopes down to 30 feet high toward the southeast.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Drow.</strong> Natural shelves and narrow ledges line the walls, ranging in height from 10 to 30 feet. Hiding in the shadows atop 10-foot-high ledges are two male <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MTk1NDJiNTdhMzcy\"><strong>drow elite warriors</strong></a>&nbsp;(Ryld and Llauzdrar).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bats.</strong> Harmless bats flutter around, disturbed by the drow&rsquo;s presence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stumps.</strong> The floor is dotted with the stumps of felled zurkhwood stalks and the occasional bat carcass impaled by a drow crossbow bolt.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ryld and Llauzdrar have taken to shooting bats with their crossbows. Intruders provide the drow with a welcome opportunity to hone their melee combat skills. If a battle turns against them, Ryld and Llauzdrar use darkness spells to cover their withdrawal to area 8. From there, they head to area 11a to make their stand. These drow aren&rsquo;t interested in conversation. If captured, however, they agree to lead their captors to area 11 to speak with the drow priestess who commands them.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Each drow elite warrior wears an obsidian scarab bearing the insignia of House Auvryndar (25 gp).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>12b. Zurkhwood Bridge</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Crevasse.</strong> A 20-foot-wide, 40-foot-deep crevasse splits the floor. Spanning the gap is the rotting trunk of a zurkhwood fungus.</li>\n<li><strong>Quaggoths.</strong> Living on natural stone shelves inside the crevasse are eight <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NzczM2ZhMTk0YzM1\"><strong>quaggoths</strong></a>&nbsp;that serve the drow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The quaggoths can climb the crevasse without having to make an ability check, as can other creatures with a natural climbing speed. A successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check is needed otherwise.</p>\n<p>Moving across the trunk without slipping or falling requires a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a failed check, the creature slips and falls prone on the makeshift bridge&mdash;but on a check that fails by 5 or more, the creature plunges into the crevasse.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>13. Zurkhwood Grove</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ceiling.</strong> This immense cavern is 50 feet high.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fungi.</strong> A forest of zurkhwood erupts from the guano- and moss-covered floor, the tallest and oldest standing over 40 feet tall. Between the towering fungi lie a few toppled zurkhwoods, as well as several stumps (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YTI4YWZjZjRhYjUz\">Fungi</a>).</li>\n<li><strong>Monsters.</strong> Near the edge of the forest, feeding on a duergar carcass, is a lone <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MDllYTliNzM5ZjQy\"><strong>carrion crawler</strong></a>. The deeper forest is guarded by four <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NzVlNGU0NzU2Y2Zh\">awakened </a><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NzVlNGU0NzU2Y2Zh\">zurkhwoods</a></strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A svirfneblin druid inhabited this grove until a few months ago, when he felt threatened by the arrival of the aboleth and decided to follow the River of the Depths back down into the Underdark. Before he left, the druid cast awaken spells on seven zurkhwoods in the grove, three of which have since been felled by duergar axes and damage-dealing spells. The four that remain are indistinguishable from normal zurkhwoods while they remain motionless. The awakened zurkhwoods try to kill or drive off creatures that cause harm to the grove. They understand Gnomish but can&rsquo;t speak it.</p>\n<p>The duergar, Iktarve Unsuttir, came up the river with some companions to cut down zurkhwoods and sell the wood&mdash;but he didn&rsquo;t count on the grove&rsquo;s fighting back. He was killed by the awakened zurkhwoods and left behind. The duergar&rsquo;s scale mail is not salvageable.</p>\n<p>The carrion crawler plans to spend the next several hours quietly devouring its meal. It attacks creatures that come within 10 feet of the dead duergar, but otherwise the crawler just wants to be left alone.</p>\n<h4>Treasure</h4>\n<p>A search of Iktarve&rsquo;s corpse and the surrounding area yields a war pick, three javelins stuck in a felled zurkhwood, and an empty lapis lazuli flask (50 gp).</p>\n<p>A thorough search of the grove accompanied by a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception or Survival) check reveals the gnome druid&rsquo;s old hovel: an igloo-like mound of hardened bat guano. Inside, characters find a ratty old blanket hiding two potions of healing in stoppered gourds. The awakened zurkhwoods attack characters who loot the druid&rsquo;s abandoned home.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>14. Drow Rafts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Darkmantles.</strong> Stalactites hang from the 30-foot-high ceiling. Two <a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZGM0YThlNTkyMGRi\"><strong>darkmantles</strong></a>&nbsp;disguised as stalactites remain motionless until they attack.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rafts.</strong> Leaning against the west wall are two 10-foot-square rafts made of zurkhwood logs lashed together with thick spiderwebs. Resting nearby are six 10-foot poles that the drow use to guide the rafts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although the darkmantles need to eat, they flee if reduced to half their hit points or fewer.</p>\n<p>The drow use the rafts to ply the River of the Depths. Each raft is built to carry six Medium humanoids and their gear, though as many as twelve people can fit onto a raft if push comes to shove.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>15. Slippery Slope</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stench.</strong> A rotting stench fills this 30-foot-high cavern.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Slimy Corpses.</strong> The slime-coated floor slopes toward an underground river. Lying in the slime are the putrid corpses of three kuo-toa and four troglodytes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Aboleth Projection.</strong> As the characters make their way along the tunnel leading west, an <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OWE2NzU3ZGI0YmRl\"><strong>aboleth</strong></a> crawls out of the water and confronts them. This aboleth is a magical projection created by Illuun to intimidate the characters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Illuun the aboleth can sense the characters&rsquo; presence and creates a magical projection of itself to interact with them. The projection lasts for as long as the aboleth maintains concentration, as if concentrating on a spell. Although the projection is intangible, it looks, sounds, and moves like the aboleth.</p>\n<p>Illuun can sense, speak, and use telepathy from the projection&rsquo;s position as if the aboleth were present at that location. If the projection takes any damage, it disappears. The aboleth has had unpleasant dealings with adventurers in the past and maintains a healthy fear of them. It uses the projection to warn characters that it will not tolerate incursions into its domain and urges them to withdraw or face extermination. It suggests the characters take the south passage to the river, then follow the current down to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZjA3ZTlkMTc0M2I5\">Level 5: Wyllowwood</a>. It&rsquo;s happy to let them descend to lower levels of Undermountain, for it plans to conquer those levels eventually itself.</p>\n<p>If the characters seem adamant about pressing deeper into the aboleth&rsquo;s lair, Illuun telepathically commands the eighteen <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZmQwNzhiMGY4ODQ3\"><strong>troglodytes</strong></a> in area 24 to circle around behind the characters (using the passage that enters area 15 from the south) while it keeps the characters engaged in conversation. At the same time, it calls the three <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MmI4NWYwZDk3NjNk\"><strong>chuuls</strong></a>&nbsp;from area 16 to come at the characters from the west, trapping them in the tunnel. As soon as the chuuls and the troglodytes arrive and begin their attack, the aboleth projection disappears.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>16. Grotto of Madness</h3>\nIlluun the aboleth has turned this flooded cavern into a den. The cavern is also defended by three chuuls that are under the aboleth&rsquo;s sway.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The water varies in depth from 20 to 50 feet, and the cavern&rsquo;s domed ceiling is 30 feet higher than the water&rsquo;s surface. The walls are coated with slime but have abundant handholds. A successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check is required to climb them.</p>\n<h4>16a. Lost Island of Bulba-Slopp</h4>\n<p>Rising out of the water is a rocky island upon which the kuo-toa raised a shrine to their old god:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chuul.</strong> Circling the island&rsquo;s perimeter is a <a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MmI4NWYwZDk3NjNk\"><strong>chuul</strong></a> that attacks anyone who sets foot on the island.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Petrified Otyugh.</strong> In the middle of the island, wearing a crude net as a cloak, is a petrified <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NzRhZjJjYmNlYjA3\"><strong>otyugh</strong></a> that the kuo-toa adopted as a god and named Bulba-Slopp. Treasure has been piled around the statue&rsquo;s three stumpy legs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Before the kuo-toa arrived, this island was inhabited by an otyugh. Halaster turned it to stone and lured kuo-toa to the grotto, knowing that the insane fish folk would come to worship the petrified otyugh as a god. The kuo-toa named it Bulba-Slopp, and it served as their god until the aboleth came on the scene. After Bulba-Slopp failed to protect the kuo-toa, the archpriest Noolgaloop set out to craft a new god, and Bulba-Slopp was worshiped no more.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> Piled around the petrified otyugh&rsquo;s feet are 3,300 cp, 670 sp, and 350 gp.</p>\n<p>The net draped over the otyugh is woven with worthless shells and bones. Tied to the net are two trinkets (roll twice on the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"ZjAzMWFmNDA5ZTZk\">Trinkets table</a> in chapter 5 of the Player&rsquo;s Handbook), a rusty gauntlet, a leather boot, and an amulet made of composite wood and iron. The boot and the amulet are both magical:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The boot is one of two boots of elvenkind. A single boot is useless without its companion. The matching boot was swept downriver and eventually found by a goblin werebat named Vool (see level 5, area 17).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The amulet controls the wandering <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZmVmYTcyMjY0NmYy\"><strong>shield guardian</strong></a> on level 1. A rune on the back of the amulet matches a similar rune on the construct.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>16b. Lake of the Aboleth</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Monsters.</strong> Illuun the aboleth and two chuuls lurk in the water, which is dark, slimy, and fouled by the aboleth&rsquo;s presence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Underwater Tunnel.</strong> A 10-foot-high, 20-foot-wide underwater passage connects this cavern to area 16c.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The aboleth and the chuuls prefer to fight underwater. In addition, the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OWE2NzU3ZGI0YmRl\"><strong>aboleth</strong></a> makes use of lair actions on this level of the dungeon. Although the aboleth wants more slaves, preserving its own life is more important. If its <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MmI4NWYwZDk3NjNk\"><strong>chuul</strong></a> bodyguards are killed, the aboleth telepathically summons the two chuuls from area 17 as it withdraws to area 16c, where it makes its final stand.</p>\n<p>The water in the northeastern half of the cave plunges to a depth of 50 feet. As one travels toward the southwest wall, the lake&rsquo;s depth shrinks to 20 feet.</p>\n<h4>16c. Treasure Trove</h4>\n<p>An underwater passage leads to this 30-foot-high cave. The water here is slimy and fouled by the aboleth&rsquo;s presence, and every surface of the cave is covered in slime.</p>\n<p>A <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZmJiMzgxNWI3NThh\"><strong>kuo-toa whip</strong></a> and two <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NDgxOTM3ZTY0NDBj\"><strong>kuo-toa</strong></a> stand guard atop a pebbled beach strewn with dead crabs, rotting fish, and treasure. These kuo-toa have been magically enslaved by the aboleth. While enslaved, the kuo-toa remain in constant telepathic contact with the aboleth, but they can&rsquo;t take reactions. Whenever an enslaved kuo-toa takes damage, it can make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw to break free of the aboleth&rsquo;s control. On a successful save, the kuo-toa flees to the underground river by the shortest route and hides there.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Treasure.</em></strong> A thorough search of the beach yields 600 gp, a copper goblet (1 gp), a tarnished and dented silver pitcher (5 gp), a rotted leather bracer inset with three peridots (500 gp each), and a corked bottle containing a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"N2Y5NzhiMWM2Yzk3\">spell scroll</a> of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"YTNlMWZhMjY4MDkx\">magic weapon</a></em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>17. Pick and Chuuls</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Slimy Water.</strong> This cave and the adjoining tunnels are flooded to a depth of 10 feet with slimy water fouled by the aboleth&rsquo;s presence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chuuls.</strong> Two <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"MmI4NWYwZDk3NjNk\"><strong>chuuls</strong></a>&nbsp;hide in the murky water. If the chuuls are defeated, an <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OWE2NzU3ZGI0YmRl\"><strong>aboleth</strong></a> enters the cavern from the northeast passage. This aboleth is a magical projection created by Illuun to frighten away invaders. (This projection is like the one in area 15.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rusty Pick.</strong> The walls and the 30-foot-high ceiling are coated in slime. A rusty miner&rsquo;s pick is stuck in the west wall just above the water line.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The miner&rsquo;s pick can be pried loose with a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check. It has no special properties and is in poor condition.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>18. Slimy Alcove</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Slime.</strong> The floor of this damp alcove is 7 feet above water level, and every surface is coated in slime.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Damaged Rowboat.</strong> At the back of the alcove is a rowboat with a 1-foot-diameter hole in its hull. (A <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"MTAxMGY1ZjkwZDNj\">mending</a></em> cantrip can repair the boat, which is large enough to hold four characters and their gear. The boat&rsquo;s oars are missing, however.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>19. Beachhead</h3>\nThis slimy beach is littered with dead crabs and fish (killed by the aboleth-tainted water). Characters who search the beach also find two fishing nets left here by the kuo-toa.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>20. Kuo-toa Refuge</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Slime.</strong> Every surface of this 30-foot-high cave is coated in slime.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kuo-toa.</strong> Two <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZmJiMzgxNWI3NThh\"><strong>kuo-toa whips</strong></a>, twenty adult <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NDgxOTM3ZTY0NDBj\"><strong>kuo-toa</strong></a>, and ten young kuo-toa (Small noncombatants) reside here. One whip stands watch by the river while the others rest on pallets. All the kuo-toa are poisoned from eating bad fish.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Caltrops.</strong> Caltrops made of sharpened bones lie scattered along the river&rsquo;s edge. (The caltrops are meant to discourage the aboleth from beaching itself in the cave. Characters can easily spot and avoid them.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The presence of the aboleth has tainted the underground river and poisoned its fish. Lacking an alternative food source, the kuo-toa have been eating the fish out of necessity, which has poisoned them. In their condition, the kuo-toa fight only in self-defense.</p>\n<p>If the characters approach the kuo-toa in a friendly manner and offer them food or relief, the kuo-toa whips lead them to the archpriest Noolgaloop in area 21a.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>21. Archpriest&rsquo;s Chambers</h3>\n<p>These caves are coated in slime.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>21a. Making a God</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kuo-toa.</strong> Noolgaloop, a <a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OGI3YzA2ZDhmNmI2\"><strong>kuo-toa archpriest</strong></a>, is building a statue in the middle of this 30-foot-high cave while two&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZmJiMzgxNWI3NThh\"><strong>kuo-toa whips</strong></a>&nbsp;stand perplexed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rotting Corpses.</strong> Mutilated monster carcasses piled around the room&rsquo;s perimeter exude a putrid stench.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Noolgaloop is unwaveringly committed to reclaiming its holy shrine (area 16), when the wiser course of action would be to lead its fellow kuo-toa to a new home far away from the aboleth and its servants. If the characters try to speak with the archpriest in a language other than Undercommon, Noolgaloop casts the tongues spell so they can converse. It demands that the characters help it complete the statue by retrieving the following items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The legs and fur of a giant spider, to be fashioned into wings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enough wood to build a chariot (a large raft or a zurkhwood mushroom would suffice)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A weapon worthy of a kuo-toa god</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the characters refuse to help, the archpriest deems them agents of the aboleth and tries to kill them with the help of its bodyguards and the kuo-toa in area 21b. If the characters gather what it needs to complete the statue, Noolgaloop thanks them but decides on a whim to replace the statue&rsquo;s current head (a rusty lantern) with the head of one of the characters. Noolgaloop fully expects the character to make this sacrifice for the good of the kuo-toa tribe.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>God Statue.</em></strong> The archpriest has already given its new god a name: Klaabu. This &ldquo;god&rdquo; sprawls on the slimy floor and consists primarily of a decapitated limestone statue depicting a bare-chested male sea elf. Its hands have been replaced with troglodyte claws, and additional limbs have been added in the form of a bugbear&rsquo;s severed arms. A pair of rusty shortsword blades thrust outward from the statue&rsquo;s breast, and it wears a kilt of green moss. A rusty lantern serves as the god&rsquo;s head, inside which rattles a fist-sized green gem&mdash;the control gem for the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"YWUxZmU4MmZlYTQx\"><strong>green slaad</strong></a> in area 4. Any character who casts <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"MTNjZDRiZDY1OThm\">identify</a></em> on the gem learns its function.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The figure&rsquo;s added parts are held in place by the same glue that the kuo-toa apply to their shields.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Monster Carcasses.</em></strong> The kuo-toa have collected more carcasses than the archpriest needs. The rotting collection includes a dead darkmantle wrapped in a net, a bugbear&rsquo;s severed head and torso, a dead hook horror, and a headless carrion crawler swarming with maggots.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>21b. Kuo-toa Carnage</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stench.</strong> The air in this cave is fantastically foul.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kuo-toa.</strong> Four poisoned <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NDgxOTM3ZTY0NDBj\"><strong>kuo-toa</strong></a> guard this area. Two of them are using spears to cut the head and claws off a dead chuul. The other two are feasting on the corpse of a dead kuo-toa (a former companion).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Troglodyte Corpses.</strong> Lying about the cave are the reeking carcasses of five dead troglodytes, one of which has had its claws hacked off.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The kuo-toa are hostile to strangers. If two or more of them are killed or incapacitated, the survivors retreat to area 21a.</p>\n<p>At the start of each turn, any creature not immune to the stench of troglodytes must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. A <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"OTAyNDI1Y2ZjOTIw\">gust of wind</a></em> spell or similar magic can clear the air in the cave for 1 minute, while removing the troglodyte carcasses clears the air for good.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>22. Hook Horror Homestead</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cave Features.</strong> This cavern has an uneven floor and ceiling, the distance between them varying from 30 to 50 feet. The damp walls are lined with natural shelves and beautiful rock draperies formed by water seepage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fungi.</strong> Growing out of mounds of bat guano are several towering zurkhwoods, as well as patches of barrelstalk, bluecap, and trillimac (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YTI4YWZjZjRhYjUz\">Fungi</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Noise.</strong> Eerie clicking sounds betray the presence of seven <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"YzJlZmIyZDViYzFl\"><strong>hook horrors</strong></a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The opportunistic hook horrors try to hook stray kuo-toa, troglodytes, or adventurers and drag them away to be devoured. Experience has taught them to avoid contact with large, well-armed groups. A party of adventurers moving through the cavern with light sources is enough to keep the hook horrors at bay, as they click and chirp eerily to one another from the shadows.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OWE2NzU3ZGI0YmRl\"><strong>aboleth</strong></a> enslaves the hook horrors or drives them off. The hook horrors have yet to encounter the aboleth and thus don&rsquo;t realize the danger it represents.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>23. Hook Horror Larder</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ambush.</strong> A <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"YzJlZmIyZDViYzFl\"><strong>hook horror</strong></a> clings to a 15-foot high ledge, waiting to ambush any who enter. The ledge is set into the western wall, between the two tunnel entrances.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bones.</strong> Lying on the floor are the bones of several troglodytes mingled with the remains of kuo-toa and other unidentifiable humanoids. Characters who search the bones find a lost treasure (see &ldquo;Treasure&rdquo; below).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fungi.</strong> Patches of barrelstalk, ripplebark, timmask, and tongue of madness grow near the water that pools against the eastern wall (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YTI4YWZjZjRhYjUz\">Fungi</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Treasure</h4>\n<p>Amid the bones is a common wondrous item called a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"YmY5YTc4NDBkZmMx\"><em>pipe of smoke monsters</em></a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>24. Troglodyte Takeover</h3>\nEvery surface of these caves is coated with slime. Sound travels easily through the caves, though as one moves toward the center of the complex, echoes from the underground river become less obtrusive.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eighteen troglodytes live in these caves and respond quickly to sounds of battle. These enslaved troglodytes can&rsquo;t take reactions. When an enslaved troglodyte takes damage, it can make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw to break free of the aboleth&rsquo;s control. On a successful save, the troglodyte fights for its own survival, not the aboleth&rsquo;s. Its first instinct is to flee if it can.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>24a. West Sentries</h4>\nThree enslaved&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff; color: #23527c; outline: 0px;\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZmQwNzhiMGY4ODQ3\"><strong>troglodytes</strong></a>&nbsp;guard this 30-foot-high cave. Shattered shields, broken spears, and torn nets (trophies taken from the kuo-toa) lie heaped against the walls. None of this gear is salvageable.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>24b. Kuo-toa Bones</h4>\nThis 30-foot-high cave is littered with the bones of four kuo-toa. The bones have all been thoroughly chewed and their marrow sucked out.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>24c. General Quarters</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Troglodytes.</strong> Unless they&rsquo;ve been drawn elsewhere, twelve enslaved&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff; color: #23527c; outline: 0px;\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZmQwNzhiMGY4ODQ3\"><strong>troglodytes</strong></a>&nbsp;rest atop sawed-off stalagmites in the middle of this 40-foot-high cave.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pictographs.</strong> The walls bear pictographs of kuo-toa abasing themselves before a creature that resembles an otyugh (a bulbous monster with three legs, long tentacles, and a gaping maw).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>24d. Abandoned Nursery</h4>\n<p>The kuo-toa used this 30-foot-high cave as a nursery. The cave has been empty since the kuo-toa were forced to vacate it. Tiny fish bones litter the floor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>24e. East Sentries</h4>\nThe underground river is loudest here. Three enslaved troglodytes guard this 30-foot-high cave.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>","img":"worlds/fl-mad-mage/journal/010_-_Level_4_3A_Twisted_Caverns/003_-_Exploring_Level_4/avatar.png","_id":"avDT7rM93xq28Ssd"}

Her long black hair is tied back with a swatch of gray cloth that matches her robe. A <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OTU0MzVlMWJiZjJl\"><strong>quasit</strong></a> in toad form sits on her knee.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Darribeth Meltimer</h4>\n<p>The woman is Darribeth Meltimer (CG female Chondathan human <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NDYwOWI2MWQzOWZk\"><strong>mage</strong></a>, with the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"NmZkNDZhODFiNjEz\"><em>darkvision</em></a> spell cast on herself and prepared instead of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"YWU2Mzc2NDJlMjU1\"><em>suggestion</em></a>). A former adventurer, she was driven insane by contact with demons in the Underdark. A <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"MDI0Mjk4MjI2ZjZh\"><em>greater restoration</em></a> spell or similar magic is needed to restore her sanity, without which Darribeth suffers from hallucinations and paranoia. If the characters approach her in a calm manner, Darribeth smiles and says to the toad on her knee, <em>“Look, Teeha! I told you they’re not demons. I wonder if Urgala sent them.”</em></p>\n<p>Darribeth desperately wants to get back to her wife Urgala, whom she hasn’t seen in a decade. When last they were together, Urgala and Darribeth were living in Amphail, a town north of Waterdeep. In the intervening years, Urgala moved farther north to the frontier town of Triboar, where she took over a modest inn called Northshield House. (See the adventure <a href=\"https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/module/25/storm-kings-thunder\">Storm King’s Thunder</a> for more information on Urgala Meltimer and her inn.)</p>\nIf her sanity is restored, Darribeth becomes her normal self—a curious and kind woman with a flair for magic who doesn’t mind bending rules for the greater good. She speaks Common, Dwarvish, Halfling, and Undercommon.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Darribeth has a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"JournalEntry\" data-id=\"NDAzN2YzYjg0ZTgx\"><em>rope of climbing</em></a> that belonged to a colleague who perished in the Underdark. She offers it as payment for getting her back to the surface. In addition, if any wizards are among her rescuers, she lets them copy spells from her spellbook (see “Treasure” below).</p>\n<p>Once restored to her right mind and borne safely to Waterdeep, Darribeth makes plans to return to Amphail. There, she learns what became of her wife and reunites with Urgala in Triboar. If the characters make the journey with Darribeth and all is well at Northshield House, Urgala is so delighted by their act of kindness that she offers them free room and board for as long as the inn remains standing. Urgala and Darribeth remain lifelong friends of the characters henceforth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Quasit</h4>\nDarribeth’s memory is fuzzy on where and when she met her talking toad during her Underdark exploits. The <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OTU0MzVlMWJiZjJl\"><strong>quasit</strong></a>, which Darribeth calls Teeha, has not revealed its true form to her. In the form of a toad, it torments her with false hopes of escape before dashing them. It has told Darribeth, for instance, that <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZGY3MTk5ZjMyNTI5\"><strong>hezrou</strong></a> demons are nearby to keep her from leaving this cavern. If attacked or exposed, the quasit turns invisible and flees.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Treasure</h4>\nDarribeth’s spellbook contains the following spells: <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"YTJhNTEzNmMyMDdj\">cone of cold</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"OTgwYzdmYjRmM2I5\">counterspell</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"NmZkNDZhODFiNjEz\">darkvision</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZWRlY2M2ZWIzMTdl\">detect magic</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"MjMyMDgyM2RmMTcx\">fireball</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ODQ4NzQ0OGQ4ODQw\">fly</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZjEyYTE5YTJhODBh\">greater invisibility</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZjA4MGM4ZTlmMzg0\">ice storm</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"MGJhNWNlNzk4ZDAw\">jump</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"MmE3MzYzMWNiMjUw\">mage armor</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"YmNkNWZhYjg1MDg0\">magic missile</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"OTEyODg5ODMxMGQ4\">misty step</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"NDlkZGI4YTU4YjRk\">shield</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"YWU2Mzc2NDJlMjU1\">suggestion</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"ZDI2YzcxZjExMjhi\">tongues</a></em>, and <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"OTJkOGI4MmE2MmI1\">water breathing</a></em>.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to her spellbook, Darribeth carries a backpack missing a strap, within which she keeps material components for her spells, a pouch containing 11 gp, a dagger, a canteen, and a worn blanket.

If the characters try to speak with the archpriest in a language other than Undercommon, Noolgaloop casts the tongues spell so they can converse. It demands that the characters help it complete the statue by retrieving the following items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The legs and fur of a giant spider, to be fashioned into wings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enough wood to build a chariot (a large raft or a zurkhwood mushroom would suffice)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A weapon worthy of a kuo-toa god</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the characters refuse to help, the archpriest deems them agents of the aboleth and tries to kill them with the help of its bodyguards and the kuo-toa in area 21b. If the characters gather what it needs to complete the statue, Noolgaloop thanks them but decides on a whim to replace the statue’s current head (a rusty lantern) with the head of one of the characters. Noolgaloop fully expects the character to make this sacrifice for the good of the kuo-toa tribe.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>God Statue.</em></strong> The archpriest has already given its new god a name: Klaabu. This “god” sprawls on the slimy floor and consists primarily of a decapitated limestone statue depicting a bare-chested male sea elf. Its hands have been replaced with troglodyte claws, and additional limbs have been added in the form of a bugbear’s severed arms. A pair of rusty shortsword blades thrust outward from the statue’s breast, and it wears a kilt of green moss. A rusty lantern serves as the god’s head, inside which rattles a fist-sized green gem—the control gem for the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"YWUxZmU4MmZlYTQx\"><strong>green slaad</strong></a> in area 4. Any character who casts <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"MTNjZDRiZDY1OThm\">identify</a></em> on the gem learns its function.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The figure’s added parts are held in place by the same glue that the kuo-toa apply to their shields.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Monster Carcasses.</em></strong> The kuo-toa have collected more carcasses than the archpriest needs. The rotting collection includes a dead darkmantle wrapped in a net, a bugbear’s severed head and torso, a dead hook horror, and a headless carrion crawler swarming with maggots.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>21b. Kuo-toa Carnage</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stench.</strong> The air in this cave is fantastically foul.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kuo-toa.</strong> Four poisoned <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"NDgxOTM3ZTY0NDBj\"><strong>kuo-toa</strong></a> guard this area.

If two or more of them are killed or incapacitated, the survivors retreat to area 21a.</p>\n<p>At the start of each turn, any creature not immune to the stench of troglodytes must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. A <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"OTAyNDI1Y2ZjOTIw\">gust of wind</a></em> spell or similar magic can clear the air in the cave for 1 minute, while removing the troglodyte carcasses clears the air for good.</p>\n<hr>\n</section></div>","img":"worlds/fl-mad-mage/journal/010_-_Level_4_3A_Twisted_Caverns/003_-_Exploring_Level_4/avatar.png","_id":"lbWKLKSJOgN9qSbZ"}

Archpriest&rsquo;s Chambers</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Chanting echoes across the cave as a corpse-stench assails your senses. Rotting in piles are the mutilated remains of monsters: troglodytes, darkmantles, a bugbear, hook horrors, and carrion crawlers swarming with maggots. At the center of this morgue is a robed kuo-toa working on a macabre effigy fashioned from viscera.</span></p>\n</section>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Noogaloop, the kuo-toa archpriest, labors over his effigy. He can explain any of the following to the adventurers:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">&bull; The \"tyrant of the deeps\" came from upstream a few weeks ago. It started out slow and cautious, only whispering to a few kuo-toa and picking off lone stragglers. Once these few were enslaved, it sent them to \"proselytize [it's] heresy\" to the tribe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">&bull; After its initial messengers were imprisoned or banished, the \"tyrant\" began to whisper directly to Noogaloop and other prominent members of the tribe, promising its \"love.\" Some obliged. Some were kidnapped by its thralls and thrown into its arms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">&bull; The drow arrived three weeks ago. After an initial assault against the kuo-toa, the \"tyrant\" arrived, ushering in an unofficial armistice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">&bull; Noogaloop's dreams are haunted by the tyrant. It can be described as a three-eyed horror with moonlit flesh and poisonous tentacles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">HALASTER'S GAME</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">The kuo-toa instead worship Halaster Blackcloak himself. This \"god\" has told Noogaloop that, if an effigy of him is brought to the Grotto of Madness, and a ritual is performed, the Mad Mage will deliver the fishfolk from this hell.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">If you use this variant, the following changes have been made to this area:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">God Statue. </span></strong><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">The statue is made of zurkhwood planks glued to a bugbear's spine with the limbs of a troglodyte. A beard of moss hangs below the rusty lantern, in which the slaad control gem rattles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Sacrifice. </span></strong><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Unlike what's written in DotMM, the archpriest doesn't seek to decapitate one of the adventurers to replace the effigy's head. He instead fully expects the adventurers to escort him to the Grotto of Madness to perform the ritual. Once the adventurers see the makeshift effigy, or the archpriest explains the situation, the Mad Mage telepathically contacts the adventurers. Read the following:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">That voice again. The voice of the Mad Mage, this time&hellip; with a hint of embarrassment:</span></p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\"See, this is the part of the story where I experimented with religion. Namely, creating one. Alas, somewhere between worship and ritual sacrifice, my disciples got it wrong. I said, 'love thy labors,' not 'love thy neighbor.' And they welcomed that new neighbor with open arms&mdash; right up until it shattered their minds and enslaved them.\"</span></p>\n</section>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>These caves are coated in slime.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4>21a. Making a God</h4>\n<div>\n<div>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kuo-toa.</strong> Noolgaloop, a <a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"OGI3YzA2ZDhmNmI2\"><strong>kuo-toa archpriest</strong></a>, is building a statue in the middle of this 30-foot-high cave while two&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"ZmJiMzgxNWI3NThh\"><strong>kuo-toa whips</strong></a>&nbsp;stand perplexed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rotting Corpses.</strong> Mutilated monster carcasses piled around the room&rsquo;s perimeter exude a putrid stench.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Noolgaloop is unwaveringly committed to reclaiming its holy shrine (area 16), when the wiser course of action would be to lead its fellow kuo-toa to a new home far away from the aboleth and its servants. If the characters try to speak with the archpriest in a language other than Undercommon, Noolgaloop casts the tongues spell so they can converse. It demands that the characters help it complete the statue by retrieving the following items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The legs and fur of a giant spider, to be fashioned into wings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enough wood to build a chariot (a large raft or a zurkhwood mushroom would suffice)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A weapon worthy of a kuo-toa god</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the characters refuse to help, the archpriest deems them agents of the aboleth and tries to kill them with the help of its bodyguards and the kuo-toa in area 21b. If the characters gather what it needs to complete the statue, Noolgaloop thanks them but decides on a whim to replace the statue&rsquo;s current head (a rusty lantern) with the head of one of the characters. Noolgaloop fully expects the character to make this sacrifice for the good of the kuo-toa tribe.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>God Statue.</em></strong> The archpriest has already given its new god a name: Klaabu. This &ldquo;god&rdquo; sprawls on the slimy floor and consists primarily of a decapitated limestone statue depicting a bare-chested male sea elf. Its hands have been replaced with troglodyte claws, and additional limbs have been added in the form of a bugbear&rsquo;s severed arms. A pair of rusty shortsword blades thrust outward from the statue&rsquo;s breast, and it wears a kilt of green moss. A rusty lantern serves as the god&rsquo;s head, inside which rattles a fist-sized green gem&mdash;the control gem for the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Actor\" data-id=\"YWUxZmU4MmZlYTQx\"><strong>green slaad</strong></a> in area 4. Any character who casts <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=\"Item\" data-id=\"MTNjZDRiZDY1OThm\">identify</a></em> on the gem learns its function.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The figure&rsquo;s added parts are held in place by the same glue that the kuo-toa apply to their shields.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Monster Carcasses.</em></strong> The kuo-toa have collected more carcasses than the archpriest needs. The rotting collection includes a dead darkmantle wrapped in a net, a bugbear&rsquo;s severed head and torso, a dead hook horror, and a headless carrion crawler swarming with maggots.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</section>\n</div>\n</div>","img":"","_id":"sD5TEHYqe1NnRxzM"}
